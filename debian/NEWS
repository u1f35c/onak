onak (0.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Upstream onak has migrated to a new .ini style configuration file,
    referred to as onak.ini instead of onak.conf. If you had local modifications
    to /etc/onak.conf they have been retained in /etc/onak.conf.dpkg-bak and
    automatically migrated to the new style in /etc/onak.ini. If you have any
    other copies of the configuration (e.g. store in home directories) then
    the "onak dumpconfig" utility can upgrade them for you. onak is still
    capable of reading old style configurations but this is expected to go away
    in a future release and no new configuration options will be available in
    the old config file format.
