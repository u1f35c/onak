onak for Debian
---------------

Before using onak you will want to edit /etc/onak.conf and set 'this_site' as
appropriate.

The OpenPGP Key Server specification uses host:11371/pks/lookup etc as the URLs,
so you will need to configure your web server as relevant.
/usr/share/doc/onak/examples contains some sample configuration files for
various web servers.
