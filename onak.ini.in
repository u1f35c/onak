; Database backend configurations below here

[backend:defaultdb4]
; The default DB4 backend. Recommended.
type=db4
location=@CMAKE_INSTALL_FULL_LOCALSTATEDIR@/lib/onak

[backend:examplehkp]
; An example HKP backend; all operations will be done against the
; provided keyserver, with no local storage.
type=hkp
location=hkp://the.earth.li/

[backend:examplestacked]
; A stacked set of backends. All fetch operations will be tried against
; the provided list of backends, from left to right, until one succeeds.
; All store operations are against the first backend.
; If a fetch does not succeed against the first backend, but against a
; later one, then the returned keys are also stored in the first backend.
; This example configuration essentially produces a caching keyserver,
; with any key fetched from the HKP backend being stored in the DB4
; backend.
; Note keys are not expired from the DB4 backend, so without any other
; update mechanism configured this will result in stale data eventually.
