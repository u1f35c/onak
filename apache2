Brett's rough guide to onak and Apache2 on Debian:

1) create a new virtual host for apache2 as the config snippet below in
	/etc/apache2/sites-available/keyserver and symlink it in
	/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/
2) edit the /etc/apache2/ports.conf file and add Listen 11371
3) edit the /etc/apache2/sites-available/default file and change the
	NameVirtualHost and VirtualHost directives to only play with
	port 80
4) make sure that suexec is *NOT* enabled in apache2 (remove the
	suexec.load symlink from /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/ if it
	exists), this is because suexec will not run the cgi scripts
	located in the /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pks directory.
5) apache2ctl graceful
6) marvel as it all works.

Apache2 config snippet:
	<VirtualHost *:11371>
		DocumentRoot /var/lib/onak
		ScriptAlias /pks /usr/lib/cgi-bin/pks
		CustomLog /var/log/apache2/keyserver-access.log combined
		ErrorLog /var/log/apache2/keyserver-error.log
	</VirtualHost>
