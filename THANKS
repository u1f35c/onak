Thanks go out to the following people for help and/or comments they've given
during the development of onak. I've probably missed some people off; if this
is you please prod me!

  Helped with porting to non x86 archs and tracking down key parsing oddities.
Ross Burton
  Provided the Debian packaging.
Jason Harris
  Several fixes and comments.
Simon Huggins
  Various fixes and idea bouncing.
Daniel Silverstone
  Convinced me about arch, wrote the keyfs backend and provided a very useful
  sounding board for ideas at DebConf.
Everyone at DebConf4 who fed me odd keys.
