* Search on key text.
* Revoked keys on index.
* Check keys on import?
* Test library?
* Better signature subpacket parsing (primary UID for example).
* Better txt2html routine.
* Remove bithelp.h (i386 only at present & inlined).
* BSD license? (Needs md5 & sha routines rewritten/replaced then)
* Pathfinder - graphical as well? Multiple paths?
* Do pathlengths for similar email addresses to help aide keysigning.
  (ie "Find me the keys furthest from mine that end ox.ac.uk'")
  Suggested by Jochen Voss <voss@mathematik.uni-kl.de>.
* Other stats. sixdegrees? with piccy? most signed? signs most?
* DB access modules as a library to allow runtime configuration of it?
* Clean up gcc warnings (`ll' length modifier especially! Also inline & wrong
  signedness for lo_read/write)
* Webpages should bt UTF-8?
* autoconf
* config file

Must do before initial release:

* Key deletion (needed for updating keys).
* Fix output to make GPG happy with --keyserver.
* Check freeing.
* More comments.
* Sort out merging (use keymerge + some Perl to answer incoming email. Not
  sure about keys via hkp yet though).
