* Revoked keys on index.
* Check keys on import?
* Test library?
* Better signature subpacket parsing (primary UID for example).
* Better txt2html routine.
* Remove bithelp.h (i386 only at present & inlined).
  - Build and test on non-i386.
* BSD license? (Needs md5 & sha routines rewritten/replaced then)
* Pathfinder - graphical as well? Multiple paths?
* Do pathlengths for similar email addresses to help aide keysigning.
  (ie "Find me the keys furthest from mine that end ox.ac.uk'")
  Suggested by Jochen Voss <voss@mathematik.uni-kl.de>.
* Other stats. sixdegrees? with piccy? most signed? signs most?
* DB access modules as a library to allow runtime configuration of it?
* Clean up gcc warnings (`ll' length modifier especially! Also inline & wrong
  signedness for lo_read/write)
* Webpages should be UTF-8?
* autoconf
* config file
* Get all keys link for pathfinder? Or even just gpg command line to C&P.
* logging framework so we can log debug/warning messages and so on. syslog?
* Change over to PQescapeString in PostgreSQL backend once Woody releases.
* Check freeing.
* More comments.
* Sort out merging (use keymerge + some Perl to answer incoming email. Not
  sure about keys via hkp yet though).
* Look at db2 backend - is it db2's fault? (Well, deadlock in that the library
  probably is...). Is there an alternative library that would provide us with
  similar features but be more reliable? gdbm?
